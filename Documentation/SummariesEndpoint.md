# Summaries endpoints

## Coverage

Coverage information for bill summaries data in the API can be found at [Coverage Dates for Congress.gov Collections](https://www.congress.gov/help/coverage-dates). By default, only bill summaries published in the last day are available from this endpoint unless "fromDateTime" and/or "toDateTime" parameters are added to the API request (read more about those parameters in the OpenAPI Specification, linked below); however, all bill summaries published for bills available on Congress.gov can be found at the [bill endpoint](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/blob/main/Documentation/BillEndpoint.md#summaries-level).
