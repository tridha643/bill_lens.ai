## A Note on Partitioned Nominations

A presidential nomination (PN) with multiple nominees may be partitioned by the Senate if the nominees follow a different confirmation path. Partitions are identified with a suffix; for example, PN230-1 (114th Congress) and PN230-2 (114th Congress). Searching on a PN number in Congress.gov API, such as PN230, without a partition designation will retrieve all partitions of a partitioned nomination.
