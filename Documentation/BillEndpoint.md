# Bill endpoints

## Coverage

Coverage information for bill data in the API can be found at [Coverage Dates for Congress.gov Collections](https://www.congress.gov/help/coverage-dates). Projects to add more historical legislative data to Congress.gov are underway. Read more about bill data at [About Legislation of the U.S. Congress](https://www.congress.gov/help/legislation) on Congress.gov.

## A Note on Bill Numbers from the 6th to 42nd Congresses (1799-1873)

Records are also available for some bills and joint resolutions from 1799 (6th Congress) to 1873 (42nd Congress); please reference [Legislation from the 6th to 42nd Congresses (1799-1873)](https://www.congress.gov/help/legislation) for more information about this collection. While these records do have text, titles, and some actions, they do not have sponsors, cosponsors, summaries, amendments, committees, and related bill information. Texts for these records are not searchable on Congress.gov, however, you may search for these bills and joint resolutions using keywords in the title or by searching using the bill number citation. Projects are underway to add more metadata to these records. Historical bills and bill text predate authenticated digital publishing. Additionally it is important to note that bills from 1799 (6th Congress) to 1817 (14th Congress) were not numbered and appear as such on Congress.gov. That means that there is not an authoritative bill number associated with these bills and the number that appears in the URL is not a bill number. Consequently, we are still looking for ways to improve the incorporation of measures from 1799 to 1873 into the Congress.gov API. This is a work in progress and a long term goal, which means that returning results from these earlier Congresses might yield results that are different from more recent Congresses, such as those from 1973 to the present. We encourage users to reach out should they have any questions about this. You can read more at [About Historical Bill Texts and Documents](https://www.congress.gov/help/about-historical-documents) on Congress.gov. 

## A Note on Reserved Bills
In recent Congresses, the resolution specifying House internal rules of procedure includes reserving bill numbers for assignment by the Speaker. In the 112th Congress (2011-2012) the practice was extended to reserve additional bill numbers for assignment by the Minority Leader. In the Senate, some of the lowest bills numbers are reserved for leadership.

## A Note on the Law Endpoints
Users can now retrieve bill data by specifying one of the following options: 
- Laws by Congress
- Laws by Congress and Law type (public or private)
- Law by Congress, Law type, and Law number.
<p>These new endpoints will use the bill endpoint's elements so please refer to the "Elements and Descriptions" section for detailed information on possible values. 
  
  
Please use the law number assigned by NARA when making a request by law number. Law numbers can be found for [Public Laws](https://www.congress.gov/public-laws/118th-congress) and for [Private Laws](https://www.congress.gov/private-laws/118th-congress) on Congress.gov. You can use the dropdown menus on both pages to switch to different Congresses.  </p>

Additionally, some codes may have been used and re-used over the years for different purposes further complicating the ability to create an authoritative list.
