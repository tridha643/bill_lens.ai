## Change #2
### Impacted endpoint: /bill/{congress}/{billType}/{billNumber}/titles
A `<titleTypeCode>` element was added to the /bill/{congress}/{billType}/{billNumber}/titles endpoint. Bill endpoint documentation was updated to account for this new element. Please refer to the updated [documentation](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/blob/main/Documentation/BillEndpoint.md) for a list of common title type codes. 
# COMPLETED April 2024, Part 2 | [Milestone](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/milestone/27)
## Change #1
### Impacted endpoint: /law/{congress}, /law/{congress}/{lawType}, and /law/{congress}/{lawType}/{lawNumber}
A law endpoint was added to the bill endpoint. Users are now able to filter law by congress, law number, and if the law is public or private. This is related to [Issue #225](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/225).

# COMPLETED February 2024, Part 2 | [Milestone](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/milestone/24)
## Change #1
### Impacted endpoint: member
Developers will investigate why empty member tags are created and prevent this from happening in the API. This is related to [Issue #183](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/183).
## Change #2
### Impacted endpoint: /member/L000174/cosponsored-legislation
A bug that is impacting the return of results related to Senator Leahy's cosponsored legislation will be investigated and fixed. 
## Change #3
### Impacted endpoints: ALL

##### **This work is ongoing from a previous sprint.**
# COMPLETED January 2024, Part 2 | [Milestone](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/milestone/22)
## Change #1
### Impacted endpoint: /treaty/{congress}/{treatyNumber}/committees
An error message, which was occuring when calls were made to the /treaty/{congress}/{treatyNumber}/committees, was  investigated and fixed. This is related to [Issue #60](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/60).
## Change #2
### Impacted endpoint: all /treaty endpoints
When requesting data related to a partioned treaty (e.g., TD 106-37A or TD 106-37B), the lower case suffix is now supported in API calls (e.g., 106-37a). This is related to [Issue #153](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/153).
## Change #3
### Impacted endpoint: /member
Congress.gov URLs were duplicating for certain members in the /member endpoint. This bug was addressed and fixed.  This was related to [Issue #156](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/156).
## Change #4
### Impacted endpoint: /bill
The bill endpoint was updated so it can accomodate historical bill data. In earlier Congresses, such as those of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there will be instances where bill numbering is not clear or evident. At this point in time, Congressional staff had not yet standardized how bills get numbered. Thus, there are instances where two legitimate bills have been assigned the same number. To make a distinction between the first session-introduced bill and the second session-introduced bill we add the “introduction date” to the URLs for these bills on Congress.gov. However, this distinction is not evident when returning data within the Congress.gov API. The API was adjusted to do this. This was related to [Issue #161](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/161).
# COMPLETED January 2024, Part 1 | [Milestone](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/milestone/21)
## Change #1
### Impacted endpoint: /bill/{congress}/{billType}/{billNumber}
The `<originChamberCode>` element was added to the detail level in the bill endpoint. 
## Change #2
### Impacted endpoint: /committee-meeting/{congress}/{chamber}/{eventID}
Error messages associated with specific event IDs in the committee-meeting endpoint were investigated and fixed fixed. This is related to issues https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/129 and https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/173.
## Change #3
### Impacted endpoint: /treaty
Several elements at the list level within the treaty endpoint were renamed. These include: 
1. `<congress>` to be `<congressReceived>`
2. `<endCongressId>` to be `<congressConsidered>`
3. `<treatyNum>` to be `<number>`
4. `<treatySuffix>` to be `<suffix>`
5. `<treatySubject>` to be `<topic>`
   
Several elements at the detail level within the treaty endpoint were renamed. These include: 
1. `<congress>` to be `<congressReceived>`
2. `<endCongressId>` to be `<congressConsidered>`
3. `<treatyNum>` to be `<number>`
4. `<treatySuffix>` to be `<suffix>`
5. `<treatySubject>` to be `<topic>`
6. `<oldTreatyNum>` to be `<oldNumber>`
7. `<oldTreatyNumDisplayStr>` to be `<oldNumberDisplayName>`
8. `<name>` (within relatedDocs.item) to be `<citation>`
9.  referrer URL values to relatedDoc items (within relatedDocs.item.url) will use the current API base URL for v3 - https://api.congress.gov/v3...)
    
These elements were added:
1. A `<countriesParties>` container element (under `<treaty>`).
2. Within each new `<countriesParties>` container element, an `<item>` container was added. In the `<item>` container a `<name>` element is present with the treaty partner name.
3. An `<indexTerms>` container element with an `<item>` for each item. In each `<item>` container, a `<name>` element was added for each index term.
4. A `<titles>` container element under `<treaty>`, which contains an `<item>` container with a `<title>` element and `<titleType>` element.

## Change #4
### Impacted endpoint: all /hearing endpoints
The hearing API endpoints returned the `<updateDate>` element in the following format: `2023-07-14 10:14:22+00:00`. This format differed from other endpoints, which returns in the following format `2023-07-14T10:14:22Z`. The following format is now used throughout the hearings API endpoint at both the list and detail level: `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z`. 
## Change #5 
### Impacted endpoint: all /amendment detail-level endpoints
The amendments endpoint was investigated so that the `<updateDate>` elements match between the detail and list levels. 
# COMPLETED December 2023| [Milestone](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/milestone/20)
## Change #1
### Impacted endpoints: all /amendment endpoints
The amendments endpoint was investigated so that the updateDate element match between the detail and list levels. This is related to [issue #112](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/112).
## Change #2
### Impacted endpoints: all /committee-meeting endpoints
URLs in the /committee-meeting endpoint now have the appropriate committee withing the URL. The URLs were investigated and corrected so that the correct committee is labeled within the URL. For example, URLs for the House Agriculture committee now have "house-agriculture."
## Change #3
### Impacted endpoints: all /member endpoints
Developers investigated and fiedx the API code so that members who have resigned but were members of the 118th Congress no longer have the `<currentMember: true>` value in their API call. 
## Change #4
### Impacted endpoint: /amendment/{congress}/{amendmentType}/{amendmentNumber}/text
For the 117th Congress and onwards, a new amendment text endpoint was made available to API users for Senate amendments and some House amendments. This change is related to [issue #18](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/18).
## Change #5
### Impacted endpoint: /bound-congressional-record
Large bound Congressional Record PDFs were investigated to see how they can be incorporated in the /bound-congressional-record endpoint. 
# COMPLETED October 2023, Part 2| [Milestone](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/milestone/18)
## Change #1 
### Impacted endpoints: /amendment/{congress}/{amendmentType}/{amendmentNumber}/actions
Developers investigated and fixed actions in the /amendment/{congress}/{amendmentType}/{amendmentNumber}/actions endpoint that have just an `<actionDate>` field with no additional elements or additional metadata present. Additional elements, such as `<text>` and `<type>`, weree added for context. This change is related to [issue #109](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/109). 
## Change #2
### Impacted endpoint: /nomination list level endpoints
The nominations list API returned the `<updateDate>` element in the following format: `2023-07-14 10:14:22+00:00`. This format differed from the nomination details API which returns in the following format `2023-07-14T10:14:22Z`. The following format is now used throughout the nominations API endpoint at both the list and detail level: `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z`. This relates to [issue #113](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/113).
## Change #3
##### Impacted endpoints: /committee, /committee/{chamber}, /committee/{congress}, /committee/{congress}/{chamber}, /committee/{chamber}/{committeeCode}, /committee/{chamber}/{committeeCode}/bills, /committee/{chamber}/{committeeCode}/reports, /committee/{chamber}/{committeeCode}/nominations, /committee/{chamber}/{committeeCode}/house-communication, /committee/{chamber}/{committeeCode}/senate-communication
Committees were adjusted and updated in the 118th Congress so that `<isCurrent>` values reflect current, existing committees. This work is related to [issue #95](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/95).
# COMPLETED October 2023, Part 1| [Milestone](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/milestone/17)
## Change #1
### Impacted endpoints: all committee endpoints 
Certain offset values were returning error messages in the committee endpoint. This error message was investigated and fixed. This change is related to [issue #116](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/116).  
## Change #2
##### Impacted endpoints: /nomination, /nomination/{congress}, /nomination/{congress}/{nominationNumber}, /nomination/{congress}/{nominationNumber}/{ordinal}, /nomination/{congress}/{nominationNumber}/actions, /nomination/{congress}/{nominationNumber}/committees, /nomination/{congress}/{nominationNumber}/hearings
The API code was reviewed to ensure that we are using the nomination's entityUpdateDate and not just its updateDate (which will only capture the nomination level metadata changes). 
## Change #3
### Impacted endpoints: bill, bill/{congress}, bill/{congress}/{chamber}, bill/{congress}/{chamber}/{billNumber}
A bug related to formerly reserved bills titles and actions was investigated. Title and other actions updates were not being recorded properly for reserved bills that are no longer reserved bills. A reserved bill is, per House of Representatives internal rules of procedure, a bill number reserved for use by the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the Minority Leader in the House of Representatives.
## Change #4
### Impacted endpoint: bill/{congress}
A bug in bill/{congress} endpoint was investigated and fixed. Users are having issues with returning results in the /bill/{congress} API when filtering by `<fromDateTime>` and `<toDateTime>`. This was related to [issue #111](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/111). Developer research found that the `<fromDateTime>` and `<toDateTime>` parameters specify the date of the last update received for the legislative entity.  It’s not a date corresponding to the legislative date or legislative action date.  For example, if HR 90000 was introduced in early March but was then updated due to a Congressional Research Service (CRS) summary of it in September, a search of bills limited to March-June wouldn't find it because the summary was updated in September. 
## Change #5
### Impacted endpoint: /house-communication/{congress}/{communicationType}/communicationNumber
In response to user feedback, the house-communication endpoint was fixed so that certain communications no longer return a "list index out of range (IndexError)" error message. This is related to [issue #121](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/121).
# COMPLETED September 2023 | [Milestone](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/milestone/16)
## Change #1
### Impacted endpoints: /hearing, /hearing/{congress}, /hearing{congress}/{chamber}, /hearing{congress}/{chamber}/{jacketNumber}
In the hearings API, at hearing items, a referrer URL element will be added to the associated committee meeting item in the API (if available). A `<url>` element will be added, when applicable, under the `<associatedMeeting>` container element.
## Change #2
### Impacted endpoints: all committee-meeting endpoints
Committee meeting events with no location (e.g., 'Data will display when it becomes available') specified on Congress.gov (see below) are returning an error message in the API. This error message will be investigated and fixed so that committee meeting events without location data still return relevant data. This change is related to [issue #122](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/122).
## Change #3
### Impacted endpoints: all endpoints in the congress.gov API
Lower case parameters (e.g., "hr") have been the default in the API and the documentation reflects this on api.congress.gov. However, some endpoints <b>unofficially</b> allowed for upper case parameters (e.g., "HR"). As a result of upgrades in our web framework, which is the underlying library that we use to implement the API, this is no longer available. Please use lower case parameters. For example, in this search (https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/117/hr/3076?api_key=[INSERT_KEY]), "hr" is lower case.    
# COMPLETED August 2023, Part 2
## Change #1
### Impacted endpoint: bound-congressional-record
Endpoints were created for the bound Congressional Record. The `<bound-congressional-record>` endpoint consists of a list level and a detail page. At the list level (<https://api.congress.gov/v3/bound-congressional-record>);  filtering by year (<https://api.congress.gov/v3/bound-congressional-record/{year}>) and by year and month (<https://api.congress.gov/v3/bound-congressional-record/{year}/{month}>) will be allowed. Data elements at the list level  include: date, volume number, congress, session number, and update date. 
# COMPLETED August 2023, Part 1 | [Milestone](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/milestone/15)
## Change #1
### Impacted endpoint: house-communication (list level) 
Related to ongoing work on the house-communication endpoint and [issue #103](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/103), the house-communication list-level endpoint was fixed so that it returns a full list of House communications. 
## Change #2
### Impacted endpoints: bill, bill/{congress}, bill/{congress}/{chamber}, bill/{congress}/{chamber}/{billNumber}
Reserved bill data was re-added to the API. A reserved bill is, per House of Representatives internal rules of procedure, a bill number reserved for use by the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the Minority Leader in the House of Representatives. The Congress.gov API was updated to include these reserved bill numbers. 
## Change #3
### Impacted endpoint: daily-congressional-record/{volumeNumber}/{issueNumber} 
Work on the Daily Congressional Record endpoints continued at the issues level (which also has the section level information).

Specifically, at the member list level (<https://api.congress.gov/v3/member?api_key=DEMO_KEY>):
1. the extra nested `<member>` was removed,
2. `<party>` was renamed to be `<partyName>`,
3. `<served>` was renamed to be `<terms>` (at members.member.served)
4. `<House>` and/or `<Senate>` was renamed to be `<item>` (at members.member.terms.House/Senate where 'terms' was renamed at number 3),
5. a new `<chamber>` element will be added under `<item>` within `<terms>` (at members.member.terms.item where 'item' was renamed at number 4 and terms was renamed at number 3),
6. `<start>` was renamed to be `<startYear>` (at members.member.terms.item where 'item' was renamed at number 4 and terms was renamed at number 3), and

## Change #2
### Impacted endpoint: amendment/{congress}/{amendmentType}/{amendmentNumber}
In response to [issue #82](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/issues/82), referrer URLs to treaty items in the API within the amendment API were fixed so that the URLs do not retrieve a 404 and instead retrieve the treaty item. This bug only impacted amendments to treaties where the congresses differ between the items (e.g., https://api.congress.gov/v3/amendment/116/samdt/924?api_key=).   
This work was ongoing from prior releases.
